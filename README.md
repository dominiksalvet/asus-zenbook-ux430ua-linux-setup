# ASUS ZenBook UX430UA Linux Setup

In default setup of ASUS ZenBook UX430UA running Linux a fan is driven very aggressively. Even when the notebook is not under any load, the fan keeps running. Also, output volume of 3.5mm jack has a very low coefficient, so volume of 3.5mm devices is scaled down significantly compared to normal state.

The described problems can be solved with this program. The program includes a simple installation wizard, which is helpful during the installation process.

## Software requirements

* using **systemd** as the init system

## Installation

To start the installation, run the program by typing the following command in a terminal emulator opened in *asus-zenbook-ux430ua-linux* directory:

```bash
sudo ./src/setup
```

The program will asks for a sudo password, because it needs to write configuration files to a location that is unaccessible to a normal user account.

Keep in mind that all original files from the *src* directory must be accessible while installing!

## Customize the fan speed policy

The fan speed policy must be stored statically in a source script to prevent accessing a file while running the script. Hence the fan speed policy is defined by values assigned to the array variable called `temps` in a *fan-config* file. A default fan speed policy looks like this:

```bash
# array of temperatures (in Celsius) per each fan speed level
temps=(55 60 62 65 68 72 76 80)
```

Table equivalent:

| Speed level   | Temperature (CÂ°) |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| 0 (off)       | 55>              |
| 1             | 60               |
| 2             | 62               |
| 3             | 65               |
| 4             | 68               |
| 5             | 72               |
| 6             | 76               |
| 7             | 80<              |

To customize the fan speed policy, edit the variable assignment of the line:

* directly in [*src/fan-config*](src/fan-config) file, if customizing **before** the installation
* in */usr/local/bin/fan-config* file, if customizing **after** the installation

Both cases require reboot to apply the changes!
